# Relational Creche Database Assignment

## Description
I have a created a database using the speicifications below along with PostgreSQL functions, triggers and queries.

## Speicifications
A local creche minds children during the day. When a child is registered, the child’s name and date of birth are recorded, along with the name they are commonly called. 
 
Two or more contacts are recorded for each child, one of whom is the preferred contact.  Contacts must provide full details; name, address, and phone number, relationship to the child and the name the child calls that person. 
 
Each child is assigned to a room of children who are at the same developmental stage as them.  When a child outgrows this stage, the child is assigned to a new room, provided it is not full.  There are a set of goals for each age group that staff encourage children to achieve, but goals can be shared by more than one room, and can vary from room to room, depending on the children’s current abilities.  Goals vary and could be anything from being able to use a cup, to sharing toys with other children.
 
After each session a child attends, the staff member who ran the session on that date gives the contact who collected the child a log of the child’s activities for the day, such as the hours they slept, what they ate and general notes relating to the child’s well-being and development.
